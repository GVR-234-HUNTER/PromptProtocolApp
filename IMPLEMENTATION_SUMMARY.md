# ADK Implementation Summary

## Overview

This project has been successfully rewritten to use Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) for implementing intelligent agents. The implementation preserves all the functionality of the original code while leveraging ADK's architecture for better agent management, session handling, and multi-model support.

## Files Created

1. **Agent Implementations**:
   - `/app/agents/worksheet_agent_adk.py`: ADK-based worksheet generator agent
   - `/app/agents/diagram_agent_adk.py`: ADK-based diagram generator agent

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/app/api/worksheet_adk.py`: FastAPI router for the worksheet agent
   - `/app/api/diagram_adk.py`: FastAPI router for the diagram agent

3. **Application Entry Point**:
   - `/app/main_adk.py`: FastAPI application using the ADK-based endpoints

4. **Documentation**:
   - `/README_ADK.md`: Comprehensive documentation for the ADK implementation

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Tool Functions

The core functionality has been implemented as tool functions with clear docstrings:

- `generate_worksheet_tool`: Creates worksheets based on textbook images
- `generate_diagram_tool`: Creates diagrams based on text descriptions

These functions follow ADK's requirements for tool definitions, including detailed docstrings that explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.

### 2. Agent Classes

Two agent classes have been created:

- `WorksheetAgentADK`: Manages the worksheet generation process
- `DiagramAgentADK`: Manages the diagram generation process

Each agent is initialized with:
- A name and description
- An instruction prompt that guides its behavior
- The appropriate tool function
- A session service for managing conversation history
- A runner for orchestrating execution

### 3. API Endpoints

The API endpoints have been updated to use the new ADK-based agents:

- Both endpoints are now asynchronous (`async def`)
- They call the agents' async methods (`generate_worksheet` and `generate_diagram`)
- They maintain the same parameter structure as the original endpoints
- They handle errors and format responses in the same way as the original endpoints

### 4. Main Application

A new main application file (`main_adk.py`) has been created that:

- Imports the ADK-based routers
- Sets up the FastAPI application
- Configures CORS middleware
- Includes the routers with appropriate URL prefixes
- Provides root and health check endpoints

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Minimal Changes**: The core functionality remains the same, with changes focused on the agent architecture.
2. **Backward Compatibility**: The API endpoints maintain the same interface as the original ones.
3. **Code Reuse**: Helper functions from the original implementation are reused where appropriate.
4. **Clear Separation**: New files are created rather than modifying existing ones, allowing for easy comparison and rollback.

## Required Packages

The ADK implementation requires these additional packages:

```
google-adk
litellm
google-generativeai
```

## Testing

The implementation has been designed to be testable through the FastAPI Swagger UI. Users can:

1. Start the server with `python -m app.main_adk`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs`
3. Try the endpoints with different parameters
4. Verify that the responses match the expected format

## Future Considerations

While the current implementation successfully integrates ADK, there are opportunities for further enhancement:

1. **True Multi-Model Support**: Currently, the implementation still calls Gemini directly in the tool functions. A more advanced implementation could use LiteLLM for true multi-model support.
2. **Persistent Sessions**: The current implementation uses in-memory session storage. A production version might use a database for persistence.
3. **Tool Result Extraction**: The current implementation calls the tools directly as a workaround. A more elegant solution would extract tool results from the session state.

## Conclusion

The ADK implementation successfully transforms the original code into a more structured, maintainable, and extensible agent-based architecture while preserving all functionality. The clear separation of concerns between tools, agents, sessions, and runners makes the code easier to understand and modify in the future.
