# Code Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup changes made to the codebase to improve readability, maintainability, and organization without changing functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Chatbot Agent (app/agents/chatbot_agent_adk.py)

#### Extracted Constants

- Created `UNSAFE_KEYWORDS` constant to avoid duplicating the list of unsafe keywords that was previously repeated three times
- Created `QUESTION_WORDS` constant for the list of question words used in educational checks

#### Created Utility Functions

- `call_gemini_api`: A centralized function for making API calls to Gemini
  - Standardized error handling
  - Consistent return format (success flag, result, error message)
  - Configurable timeout and model parameters
  
- Simple fallback functions for each AI-based check:
  - `simple_topic_extraction`: Extracts a simple topic from a message
  - `simple_educational_check`: Checks if a message appears to be educational
  - `simple_safety_check`: Checks if content appears to be safe
  - `simple_topic_similarity`: Checks if two topics appear to be similar

#### Refactored Helper Functions

- Updated all helper functions to use the utility functions:
  - `_extract_topic`
  - `_is_educational_question`
  - `_are_topics_similar`
  - `_is_safe_content`
  
- Simplified error handling by leveraging the utility functions
- Removed duplicate code for fallback mechanisms

#### Improved Session State Management

- Added better error handling in `get_session_state` and `update_session_state`
- Simplified the session state update logic
- Added checks for null session objects

#### Improved Type Hints

- Added more specific type hints using Optional, List, and Tuple
- Added return type annotations for all functions
- Improved documentation for function parameters and return values

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated repeated code patterns for API calls, fallback mechanisms, and error handling.

2. **Improved Maintainability**: Centralized common functionality in utility functions, making future updates easier.

3. **Better Error Handling**: Standardized error handling across all functions, ensuring consistent behavior.

4. **Enhanced Readability**: Cleaner code structure with better organization and documentation.

5. **Type Safety**: Improved type hints help catch potential errors during development.

## Potential Future Improvements

1. **API Client Abstraction**: Create a dedicated Gemini API client class to further encapsulate API interaction details.

2. **Configuration Management**: Move constants like `UNSAFE_KEYWORDS` to a configuration file for easier updates.

3. **Logging System**: Implement a proper logging system instead of using print statements.

4. **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for the utility functions and helper functions to ensure they work as expected.

5. **Error Recovery**: Implement more sophisticated error recovery mechanisms for API failures.

6. **Caching**: Add caching for API responses to improve performance and reduce API calls.

7. **Async Optimization**: Further optimize the async code patterns for better performance.

## Conclusion

The cleanup changes have significantly improved the code quality without changing functionality. The code is now more maintainable, readable, and robust, making it easier for future developers to understand and extend.
