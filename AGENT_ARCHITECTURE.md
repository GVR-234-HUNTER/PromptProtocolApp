    # Multi-factor quality assessment
    # - Length appropriateness
    # - Content relevance
    # - Grade-level suitability
    # - Confidence indicators
```

### 2. Adaptive Response Strategies
```python
def _adapt_response_style(self, session_state: Dict, grade_level: str, complexity: int):
    # Dynamic style adaptation based on:
    # - User interaction patterns
    # - Question complexity trends
    # - Session length and engagement
    # - Grade level requirements
```

### 3. Autonomous Decision Making
```python
def _make_autonomous_decisions(self, session_state: Dict, context: Dict):
    # Intelligent decision making for:
    # - Diagram generation triggers
    # - Worksheet suggestions
    # - Difficulty adjustments
    # - Response strategies
```

### 4. Proactive Learning
```python
def _learn_from_interaction(self, session_state: Dict, interaction_data: Dict):
    # Continuous learning from:
    # - User preferences
    # - Success patterns
    # - Concept relationships
    # - Complexity preferences
```

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```python
circuit_breaker = {
    "failure_count": 0,
    "last_failure_time": 0,
    "state": "closed",  # closed, open, half_open
    "failure_threshold": 5,
    "recovery_timeout": 60
